# nds-planner
simple html + js page to assist in planning of navigational data sheet (nds)

## instructions
1. on the map, choose a series of waypoints connected by straight-line paths
2. add the waypoints into the list
3. add/edit/delete points where necessary
4. once done, click "generate" to generate a basic nds

## features
- add waypoints into an organised, ordered list
- edit waypoints
- delete waypoints
- generate a basic nds using waypoints
- calculate the distance and direction between waypoints on the nds

## potential future works
- improved ui
- saving of progress
- sharing of routes
- co-editing

## about
i first thought of using math to assist in planning of the nds in aug 2021, finally started work on this in apr 2022, likely not going to touch this for a while to focus on other projects. 

contact me at galenlee1@gmail.com to report bugs (there will be many bugs because this is just a proof of concept) or for collaboration.
